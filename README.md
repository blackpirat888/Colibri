# 🐦 Colibri

**Colibri** is a lightweight offline utility designed for analyzing structural patterns in early-era datasets (2009–2012).
It works entirely on-device using an embedded, read-only reference set.

### 🚀 Features

* Processes legacy and modern binary formats (compressed, uncompressed, x-only)
* Matches computed digests against a fixed reference set
* Logs any detected matches to a local file (MATCHES)
