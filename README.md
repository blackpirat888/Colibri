# Colibri – Bitcoin Key Scanner (2009–2012)

**Colibri** is an offline Android application designed to scan private key ranges and detect possible matches against a fixed, internal hash database originating from the early Bitcoin era (2009–2012).

## Features
- Private key generation (randomized)
- Compressed and uncompressed public key support
- Hashing via RIPEMD160 and SHA256
- Built-in read-only hash database (not modifiable)
- Taproot (x-only pubkey) and P2WSH support
- Fully offline – no internet connection required

## Security and Privacy
- All computations happen on-device
- No data is ever sent or stored
- The app does not access location, files, or media
- User cannot upload custom hashes – the database is fixed and protected

## Legal Position
Colibri follows the legal analogy of discovering a "treasure trove":

> A treasure is something hidden in the past, whose owner is unknown or has forgotten it.  
> The right to claim it belongs to the one who finds it – as long as the law is not violated.

In international practice, treasure trove may be legally claimed if:
- The original owner cannot be identified
- The discovery was made honestly
- Property rights are not infringed

Colibri respects this principle by:
- Working only with a fixed, non-editable database
- Not targeting specific addresses
- Not allowing user-uploaded content

> Colibri is a safe, honest, offline exploration tool for early lost BTC.
