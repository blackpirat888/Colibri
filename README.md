# Colibri

## Offline tool for analyzing fixed historical cryptographic patterns

Colibri is a lightweight offline utility designed for structural analysis within historical (2009–2012) cryptographic keyspaces.  
The tool operates on a static, embedded dataset derived from legacy cryptographic structures and enables secure, on-device exploration.

### 🚀 Features

• Internally generates randomized key-like sequences  
• Processes compressed, uncompressed, and x-only data formats  
• Calculates standard hashes for internal matching  
• Compares hash outputs with an embedded, fixed reference set  
• If a structural match is found, it is recorded in the MATCHES file  

Colibri uses optimized local algorithms to ensure efficient, private, and isolated operation — fully offline.

### 🔐 Security & Intended Use

Colibri performs all computations locally on the user’s device, without accessing personal data or system content.
It operates independently, with no internet connection or integration with external sources.

The internal dataset is fixed, read-only, and cannot be modified.
Designed for research, structural analysis, and educational use, Colibri runs in a fully private environment.

➡️ Colibri enables focused, standalone analysis of historical key structures.
