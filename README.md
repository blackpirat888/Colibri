# Colibri

## Offline tool for analyzing fixed historical cryptographic patterns

Colibri is a lightweight offline utility designed for structural analysis within historical (2009–2012) cryptographic keyspaces.  
The tool operates on a static, embedded dataset derived from legacy cryptographic structures and enables secure, on-device exploration — fully offline.

### 🚀 Features
• Internally generates randomized key-like sequences  
• Processes compressed, uncompressed, and x-only data formats  
• Calculates standard hashes for internal matching  
• Compares hash outputs with an embedded, fixed reference set  
• If a structural match is found, it is recorded in the MATCHES file  

Colibri uses optimized local algorithms to ensure efficient, private, and isolated operation — fully offline.

### 🔐 Security and Privacy
• All computations are performed entirely on the user’s device  
• The app does not collect, transmit, or store any user data  
• No access to location, contacts, media, or external files  
• The internal dataset is fixed and cannot be modified by users

---

### ⚖️ Legal & Intended Use
Colibri performs local computations using a fixed internal dataset, embedded within the application.  

It does not interact with external sources, user accounts, or real-time systems.  
The tool is designed solely for research, structural analysis, and educational purposes in cryptographic contexts.  

➡️ Colibri enables transparent, isolated analysis of historical key structures — fully offline.
