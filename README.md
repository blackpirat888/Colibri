# Colibri

## Offline tool for analyzing fixed historical cryptographic patterns

Colibri is a lightweight offline utility designed for structural analysis within historical (2009–2012) cryptographic keyspaces.  
The tool operates on a static, embedded dataset derived from legacy cryptographic structures and enables secure, on-device exploration.

### 🚀 Features

• Internally generates randomized key-like sequences  
• Processes compressed, uncompressed, and x-only data formats  
• Calculates standard hashes for internal matching  
• Compares hash outputs with an embedded, fixed reference set  
• If a structural match is found, it is recorded in the MATCHES file  

Colibri uses optimized local algorithms to ensure efficient, private, and isolated operation — fully offline.

### 🔐 Security & Intended Use

Colibri operates entirely offline, performing all computations locally on the user’s device.  
It does not collect, transmit, or store any user data, and has no access to location, contacts, media, or external files.

The internal dataset is fixed, read-only, and cannot be modified by users.  
Colibri does not connect to external sources, live systems, or real-time data.

This tool is intended solely for research, structural analysis, and educational use in cryptographic contexts — fully isolated and privacy-respecting.

➡️ Colibri enables transparent, offline analysis of historical key structures in a secure environment.
