## 🔐 Security and Privacy

## ⚖️ Legal Position

Colibri follows the legal analogy of discovering a **"treasure trove"**:

> A treasure is something hidden in the past, whose owner is unknown or has forgotten it.  
> The right to claim it belongs to the one who finds it – as long as no laws are violated.

In international practice, a treasure trove may be claimed if:

- The original owner **cannot be identified**
- The discovery was made **honestly**
- **No property rights** are infringed

**Colibri respects this principle by:**

- Working only with a **fixed, non-editable** database
- Not targeting specific addresses
- Not allowing user-uploaded content

➡️ *Colibri is a safe, honest, offline exploration tool for early lost BTC.*
